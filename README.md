# Git and GitHub

I've had some general idea about Git and basic concepts like commits, branches, merging and pull requests as I've had experience working in a development team as a tester. However how it all is done in practice seemed like rocket science to me (especially "scary" rebasing, cherry-picks and resolving merge conflicts). Now I see it is absolutely not :).  
Pretty much everything in courses was __new to me__:  

- making changes to commits with `git revert` and `git reset`
- working with remote repo with `git push`, `git fetch` and `git pull`
- juggling branches with `git rebase`, `git merge`, `git cherry-pick` etc.

 __What surprised me__ is how flexible Git is, as there is always a way to fix a mistake and it's quite hard to make a fatal one.
